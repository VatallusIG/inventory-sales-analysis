# Inventory Sales Analysis

## Objective
Analyze sales performance, inventory activity, and delivery efficiency for a simulated multi-warehouse retail operation. 
Identify top-performing product categories, seasonal sales trends, and operational bottlenecks. 
Recommend actions to optimize inventory allocation and delivery processes.

## Dataset
- **Source:** Simulated dataset created for portfolio purposes
- **File:** `data/sample_inventory_dataset.csv`
- **Fields:** Order_ID, Product_Category, Order_Date, Units_Ordered, Unit_Price, Warehouse_Location, Delivery_Time_Days, Total_Sales

## Tools Used
- Excel (Pivot Tables, Charts, Dashboards)
- SQL (Data Querying)
- Tableau (Data Visualization)

## Process
1. Imported dataset into Excel and SQL environment
2. Cleaned and formatted data
3. Built pivot tables to analyze revenue, units sold, and delivery time
4. Created visualizations to present findings
5. Developed actionable recommendations based on insights

## Key Insights
- Home Goods generated $31,640 in sales, representing 29.3% of total revenue, and accounted for 30% of total units sold â€” the highest across all categories
- Pet Supplies ranked second with $31,589 in revenue and 336 units sold, indicating strong demand similar to Home Goods
- Order volumes peaked in January and September (both 138 units), suggesting potential seasonal demand spikes
- NY warehouse averaged the fastest delivery time at 6 days, while PA averaged 6.8 days, a difference of 12.5% that may affect customer satisfaction

## Recommendations
- Maintain optimal stock levels for Home Goods and Pet Supplies, increasing allocation ahead of peak months to meet projected demand
- Investigate drivers behind lower sales in March, focusing on promotional activity, stock availability, and market demand shifts
- Analyze PA warehouse operations to identify delivery bottlenecks, and pilot routing high-priority orders through NJ or NY to reduce delivery time
